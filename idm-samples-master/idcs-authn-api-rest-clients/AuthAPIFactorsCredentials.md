# Oracle Identity Cloud Service's Authentication API MFA Factors and Credentials

The SSO Authentication APIs for Oracle Identity Cloud Service REST client samples contain a collection of sample REST API requests that can be used with clients such as [Postman](http://getpostman.com) to make test calls to Oracle Identity Cloud Service. 

This document describes the Types of credentials required to perform authentication using MFA factors, and the credentials that can be supplied for a given type of MFA factor for the Authentication APIS for Oracle Identity Cloud Service.

## MFA Factors and Credentials

A user is expected to pass the user name and password as "credentials" while trying to perform the first factor authentication in Oracle Identity Cloud Service. When using MFA, the type of credentials vary based on the factor being used as the second authentication factor. The table lists the types of credentials required to perform authentication using MFA factors such as SMS, PUSH, TOTP, and so on.
