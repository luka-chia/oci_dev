# Oracle Identity Cloud Service REST Client Samples

This code contains a collection of sample REST API requests that can be used with clients such as [Postman](http://getpostman.com) to make test calls to Oracle Identity Cloud Service. 

This application is provided “AS IS” with no express or implied warranty for accuracy or accessibility. The sample code is intended for study purposes, doesn't represent the recommended approach, and isn't intended to be used in development or production environments.

The [Using the Oracle Identity Cloud Service REST APIs with Postman](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=44785:112:13055075037206::::P112_CONTENT_ID,P112_PREV_PAGE:13484) tutorial is available to use with this REST API collection. 

## Requirements

- The Postman native app installed for Windows, Mac, or Linux [Postman Native App Download](https://www.getpostman.com/apps).
    **Note**: Currently, you can still use the Chrome Web Browser with [Postman Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client-packa/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop), but Google plans to end support for Chrome apps for Windows, Mac, and Linux users in late 2017. These steps are written from the perspective of the Postman native app.
- Register and activate a client application in Oracle Identity Cloud Service with the following characteristics, and then copy the application `client id` and `client secret`:

---
- **Application Type**: Trusted
- **Name**: REST Test
- **Description**: This client is used to test REST API calls
- **Authorization**: Select **Configure this application as client now**
- **Allowed Grant Types**: Select **Client Credentials**
- **Grant the client access to Oracle Identity Cloud Service Admin APIs**: Select this check box, and then in the box that appears, select **Identity Domain Administrator**
